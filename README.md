## Overview
Roza has partnered with Improbable Foods to research the most ideal bacterial species that can provide the best tasting synthetic beef, and it just so happens to be found in our belly buttons! With the help of anonmous participants (given an ID number) throughout the country, Roza has completed and provided sample panels/graphs for demographic information and visualization. Participants can select their test subject ID number to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
